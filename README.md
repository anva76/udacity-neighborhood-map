# Neighborhood Map
This is a single page application that implements a neighborhood map with popular tourist locations via the Google Map API.

## Usage notes
When you open the page, you will see a list of popular locations and a Google map. The list view on the left allows selecting and filtering locations. Each location has a corresponding marker displayed on the map.
If you click on a marker or select a location in the list view, an information window is opened.
In this window, you can find some additional details regarding the selected location and get related information from popular websites such as Foursquare, Wikipedia, and Flickr. The information from Foursquare, Wikipedia, and Flickr is shown in a separate window, which is scrollable. And the information elements (venues, photos) are clickable. 

## Installation notes
Clone this git repository or download the files to a specific folder on your computer. Open _index.html_ in your browser.
